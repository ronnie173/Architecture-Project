 * contained in files.
 * 
 * It is important to note that all of the objects retrieved by these DAOs will
 * be sub-classes of EntityObject. This is important because objects are managed
 * in Maps which are keyed on EntityObject's ID attribute.
 * 
 * It is expected that entity objects are created by the user with a text
 * editor. DAO's can only read objects from XML, and can not store an object's
 * state back to its file.
